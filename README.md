Data science experts expect this trend to continue with increasing development in the Python ecosystem. And while your journey to learn Python programming may be just beginning, it’s nice to know that employment opportunities are abundant (and growing) as well.

According to Indeed, the average salary for a Data Scientist is $121,583.

The good news? That number is only expected to increase, as demand for data scientists is expected to keep growing. In 2020, there are three times as many job postings in data science as job searches for data science, according to Quanthub. That means the demand for data scientitsts is vastly outstripping the supply.

So, the future is bright for data science, and Python is just one piece of the proverbial pie. Fortunately, learning Python and other programming fundamentals is as attainable as ever. We’ll show you how in five simple steps.

But remember – just because the steps are simple doesn’t mean you won’t have to put in the work. If you apply yourself and dedicate meaningful time to learning Python, you have the potential to not only pick up a new skill, but potentially bring your career to a new level.
